# PostgRESTSharp

![Logo](logo.png "Logo")

PostgRESTSharp is a wrapper built on top of the [PostgREST](https://github.com/begriffs/postgrest) REST server. PostgRESTSharp has convention-based generators that enable you to generate PostgREST views for your API as well as Nancy module generators that create a more standardised REST API that includes HAL links.

PostgREST is currently ALPHA software and breaking changes will occur regularly.
